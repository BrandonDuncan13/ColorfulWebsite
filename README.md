# Colorful Website (Tea Website)
A partial website for a made-up company called 'Tea-commerce', a company that allows users to select ingredients to create a custom blend of loose-leaf tea. The website
has four sections: home, about, services, and sign-up.

This was a project that I worked on for a few days to work more with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this project was fun, it was also a great learning opportunity to 
better understand web development, teaching me more about HTML tags, CSS styling, and how to add interactivity to a website.
